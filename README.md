# CNN: Dog Breed Classifier
This was project 2 of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. 

As a learning exercise, I created my own CNN architecture and trained a dog breed classifier from scratch. For the final app, I utilized transfer learning. Using OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers, I detected human faces in images, and predicted the breed which the human most resembled. If a dog was instead in the image, the dog breed was predicted.
